## Overview

**Project Title**:
Smart Chicken Coop Controller

**Project Description**:
A touch screen device that allows the user to control relays, this would help the user know if chicken coop devices are working properly.

**Project Goals**:
1) Use a microcontroller to build a Smart controller

2) Have Touch Functionality

3) Display a page

4) Have functional buttons that control actual inputs or outputs.

5) Have multiple dynamic titles or labels that update on change

Stretch Challenge:

Get the device to connect to wifi for accurate Time and Date settings

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. To build the software make sure you have all livraries installed
2. Make sure to have your accurate Wifi Credentials inserted into the code
3. Build and run the Software using arduino IDE

Instructions for using the software:

1. The software is fairly simple, you turn it on it should connect to your wifi
2. Push the different buttons to turn on or off different devices
3. The time and date settings should automatically update

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* LVGL 8.3.11
* Arduino IDE
* Squareline Studios IDE
* ui.h file generated from squareline studios

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Squareline Studios](https://squareline.io)
* [Wifi library](https://docs.arduino.cc/libraries/wifi/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Settings page with ability to change wifi credentials
* [ ] Ability to initialize display and wifi at the same time without collisions
* [ ] Actual wifi control of the device
